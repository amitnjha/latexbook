\section {This is the first section}
\subsection {Introduction to Hadoop}
Hadoop\footnote{Hadoop is the name of a toy elephent} is the foundation for big data applications in whole range of industry domain.Since its launc in 2001 it has scaled up to be one of the cutting edge technology when it comes to ingesting and processing huge amount of structured and unstructured data.
\subsection {Introduction to Spark}
Spark is a distributed computing engine that was first developed at UCLA (\emph{correction needed}). It runs on top of Hadoop and has support for various programming languages such as Scala, Python and Java.
\section {This is the second section}
This section is for some of the basic formulas.
\begin{itemize}
\item $(a+b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + 2ab$
\item $(a-b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab$
\item $(a+b)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 $
\end{itemize}

\subsection {Changing Type Style}

%shape
\textup{Upright Shape Usually the default}

\textit{italic shape Often used in emphasized text}

\textsl{slanted text.. bit different from italic}

\textsc{small caps shape. Use sparingly}

%series
\textmd {medium series text, usually the defaul}

\textbf {Boldface series Often used for headings.}

%family
\textrm {Roman family usually the default one}

\textsf {San serif family often used in ads}

\texttt {Typewriter family used by hacker}

\textit{This is going to be italic}

\subsection {Mathematical Formulas}

\textbf {Fractions ---}

Multiplying by  $ n/2 $ gives $(m+n)/n$

Complicated Fraction --- \[ x = \frac{y + z/2}{y ^ {2} +1}\]
\[\frac{x+y}{1 + \frac{y}{z+1}}\]

\textbf {Roots -}

The square root $ \sqrt{x+y}$ and $\sqrt[n]{x+y} $ are different

\textbf {Ellipses --}

A low ellipses : $x_{1}, \ldots , x_{n}$.

A centered ellipses : $ a + \cdots + z $

The vdots are like this $ \vdots $

The ddots are like this $ \ddots $

\subsection {Mathematical Symbols}

Pi = $\Pi$
Alpha = $\alpha$
beta = $\beta$
Sigma = $\Sigma$

similarity = $ \frac{\Sigma (x_{i})} { \Sigma (x + y_{i})}$

summation and integration --- \[\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i} =  \int_{0}^{1}f \]

\subsection{Putting one thing above another}

\( \overline{\overline{x}^2 + 1} \)

$\overbrace{a+ \underbrace{b+c}+d}$

\underline{The} value is $\underline{3x}$

\( \vec{a} + \vec{b} \)
