You can have \emph{emphasized text \emph{within} emphasized text also}.

Gnus \footnote{Gnu is a big animal} can be quite a gnusance.
However cows \footnote{cow is a big animal too} are not that big of a gnusance.

%formula

A formula is easy to write such has \(x+7y = 9\)

Does \(x  + y \) always equal to \(y+x\)?
Here is subscript and superscript formula -- \(a_1 + b_1 = 2\) superscript \(a^n + b^5 = 89\)

Let $x$ be a prime such that $y > 2x$

\begin{math} x + 3+ y_1 + x^{2y} = 89 \end{math}
